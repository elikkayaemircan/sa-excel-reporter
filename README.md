# SA Excel Reporter

A project to generate excel from csv file which is generated at sa-global-shell-runner.

## Usage

This code is designed as a module of sa-global-shell-runner to run at another server. It gets the csv report generated with sa-global-shell-runner and turn it into excel and send an email. There exist other kind of integrations in addition to TELEGRAF but all are based on same structure. I only add TELEGRAF here.

## Disclaimer

The code in this repository is developed by me as a side project. I use them in my company as well. The version that I use in my company differs from the one published here. All the information is unrelated with the one using inside.

I share them to show only my coding experience.
